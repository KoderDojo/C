# Data Structures

Various data structures coded in multiple programming languages while learning C and C++.

## Queue

A queue is a first-in, first-out data structure that is known for 2 important operations: **enqueue**, which adds an element to the queue, and **dequeue**, which removes an element from the queue. Some queues have a bounded capacity while other queues will accept any number of elements.

* [fixed-array-c](https://github.com/dev-nano/c/tree/master/datastructures/queue/fixed-array-c) - A queue data structure programmed in C that uses a static array to hold the elements in the queue. The *capacity*, maximum number of elements that the queue can hold, is specified upon creation. Any attempt to add more elements than the capacity causes the application to exit. Any attempt to *dequeue* from an empty queue will also cause the application to exit.

## Stack

A stack is a last-in, first-out data structure that is known for 2 important operations: **push**, which adds an element to the stack, and **pop**, which removes an element from the stack. Another common operation is **peek**, which returns the next element to be popped from the stack, but doesn't actually remove it. Some stacks have a bounded capacity while other stacks will accept any number of elements.

* [fixed-array-c](https://github.com/dev-nano/c/tree/master/datastructures/stack/fixed-array-c) - A stack data structure programmed in C that uses a static array to hold the elements in the stack. The *capacity*, maximum number of elements that the stack can hold, is specified upon creation. Any attempt to add more elements than the capacity causes the application to exit. Any attempt to *peek* or *pop* from an empty stack will also cause the application to exit.

## Code

The C and C++ code is written with **JetBrains CLion**.

The C# code is written with **Visual Studio 2017** or **JetBrains Rider**.
