# Practice C

There are many websites that offer programming challenges to help you become a better coder. I have used quite a few in the past to practice Python, Java, and JavaScript.

Now I will start to use these websites to practice C and C++.

## Codewars

[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) has [coding challenges](https://github.com/dev-nano/c/tree/master/practice/codewars) in numerous programming languages. I'll start with 8 kyu challenges and progress to more difficult C and C++ challenges as I gain more expertise with the language.

If you're interested, you can join a clan and have allies. I started a clan, called DevNano. I'd be honored to have you in my clan and we can learn C and C++ together.

## HackerRank

[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) also offers [programming challenges and tutorials](https://github.com/dev-nano/c/tree/master/practice/hackerrank) in a variety of languages. They have several categories of practice, like data structures and algorithms, as well as tutorials, which are my favorite: **30 Days of Code**, **Cracking the Coding Interview**, and **10 Days of Statistics**.

A good tutorial to start with is **30 Days of Code**. I'll start with that and move on to algorithms and data structures.

## Algorithms Matter

> In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a self-contained step-by-step set of operations to be performed - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm).

When I solve these programming challenges I will try to mention the scalability of the algorithm used to solve the solution using [Big O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation) when I know there is a faster solution.

Case in point, the [7 kyu Find Twins solution on Codewars](codewars/kyu-7-find-twins.c) is O(n^2) and I realize sorting and performing a linear search will get us O(nlogn) with a good sorting algorithm. The comment makes note of that fact, and I hope to return to these solutions at some point and improve them.

## Code

The C and C++ code is written with **JetBrains CLion**.

The C# code is written with **Visual Studio 2017** and **JetBrains Rider**.
