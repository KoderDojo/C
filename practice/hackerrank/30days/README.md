# HackerRank's 30 Days of Code

Let's complete **HackerRank's 30 Days of Code** using C and C++ together.

For the most part I will try to complete the programming challenges in order, but if a challenge is more challenging than I have time for at that moment, I may skip it and return to it later.

### Skipped Challenges:

* **Day 4: Class vs. Instance** - C doesn't have classes so I'll do this one in C++ at some point.
* **Day 8: Dictionaries and Maps** - C doesn't have these data structures out-of-box, but I do like the idea of using an array with a custom hash function to complete this. I'll save this for another day in C and complete it in C++ at some point.
