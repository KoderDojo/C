# C - Learn Computer Programming

This repository is a collection of thoughts, tutorials, samples, and [homework assignments](https://github.com/dev-nano/c/tree/master/homework) associated with the **Learn Computer Programming - DevNano** Meetup in Lehi, Utah. The meetup is currently teaching the fundamentals of C programming.

Although I have many years of experience coding in C# and other C-based languages, I have never learned C and C++. C, in particular, has proven to be fun and challenging. I am taking additional courses, reading books, and coding above and beyond what we do in the meetup to get much better at it.

## Above and Beyond the Meetup

In this repository are examples, tutorials, and homework solutions above and beyond what is taught in the meetup. I'm hoping this is actually helpful to other developers in the class as it exposes them to additional concepts and techniques.

However, I am jumping way ahead, and many of the concepts may be way too advanced at this point. Feel free to ignore them, or if you are curious, I would be happy to explain any of the code. Having to explain my code will only make me a better developer and help expose any misunderstandings and errors in my thinking.

## Algorithms and Data Structures

Two of my favorites subjects are **algorithms** and **data structures**. I enjoy learning them from an academic perspective as well as how and when to use them in my applications. I've taken several courses on the topics and enjoy coding them using many programming languages.

In this repository you'll find examples of [data structures](https://github.com/dev-nano/c/tree/master/datastructures) and [algorithms](https://github.com/dev-nano/c/tree/master/algorithms) in C and C++ as well as other languages. This is not currently being taught in the meetup, but this is useful knowledge for developers as well as good practice and review for myself. I won't be diving deep into the academics, but I do provide a simple introduction that explains the topic. I will continue to build on these topics as time goes on.

**Data Structures:** [Queue](https://github.com/dev-nano/c/tree/master/datastructures/queue/fixed-array-c), [Stack](https://github.com/dev-nano/c/tree/master/datastructures/stack/fixed-array-c)

**Algorithms:** [Linear Search](https://github.com/dev-nano/c/blob/master/algorithms/search/linear-search.c)

## Notes

Concepts and techniques I wish to remember while learning C. I especially wish to capture those **aha** moments. I wish I started this area sooner.

* While mentoring a student in Python I challenged myself to implement [reduce in C](notes/reduce.md) like we did in Python.

## Practice

There are many websites that offer programming challenges to help one become a better programmer. I use them regularly to stay sharp on several programming languages as well as data structures and algorithms. Recently I used them to become good at Python, and now I am using them to become better at C and C++.

Currently I am re-solving all the **30 Days of Code** challenges at **HackerRank** using C and C++. View my [solutions to 30 Days of Code on HackerRank using C and C++](https://github.com/dev-nano/c/tree/master/practice/hackerrank/30days).

I solved many **Codewars** programming challenges using C. View my [solutions to Codewars programming challenges](https://github.com/dev-nano/c/tree/master/practice/codewars). I am now focusing my attention on solving Codewars programming challenges using Go, so I may solve challenges in C from time-to-time, but at a slower pace.

## Projects

A list of [personal projects](https://github.com/dev-nano/c/tree/master/projects) that I have created to help learn C and C++.

### Hangman

I think both the code and game turned out pretty well. It uses pluggable *move functions* that allow user vs. computer and computer vs. computer using a variety of computer personas. See [Hangman Game](https://github.com/dev-nano/c/tree/master/projects/01-hangman).

```
****************** Hangman ********************
*                                             *
* Guess the secret word by choosing letters   *
* 'a' through 'z'. You can quit at any time   *
* using the '#' symbol.                       *
*                                             *
* You get 5 incorrect guesses.                *
*                                             *
