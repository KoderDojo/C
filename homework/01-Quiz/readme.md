# Quiz App

The first and second homework assignments are a quiz app. The app is to ask the user a set of questions, keep track of the number of correct answers, calculate the percent correct, and assign a letter grade.

In the **first homework assignment** the coder can use a pre-defined set of questions and answers, and in the **second homework assignment** the user must input the questions and answers.

## Solutions

Alhough I coded several solutions using a variety of techniques, I have only included a few of the solutions that may be interesting to other developers in the class.

* **main-functions.c** -> This solves the first homework assignment. All questions are generated dynamically in a loop. I wrote this solution in response to a conversation in Slack. In addition, I used **functions**, which had not been taught at this point.
* **main-struct.c** -> This solutions uses a **struct** to keep the question and answer together as a single data container. Since C does not have classes this is the closest I could get to using OOP fundamentals. **Typedef** and **struct** had not been taught at this point.
* **main.cpp** -> A solution using C++. This helps one appreciate **vector** and **string** in C++, which alleviate a lot of complexity and code when using C. C++ is not being taught, but I think it's worth comparing and contrasting the two languages when learning C.
* **main-ptp.c** -> A pretty complex solution at this point given we just started learning C. I've jumped ahead and learned **pointer**, **pointer-to-pointer**, and memory allocation via **malloc**. This is essentially modeling a 2D Array.
* **program.cs** -> A C# example that is quite similar to the C++ solution. I threw this in there to show another C-based language, and prove that once you learn C and C++ you can navigate pretty easily to any other C-based language. C# **List** is similar to C++ **vector** and both use **string** as opposed to a char array.

I also completed these homework assignments as **single-page web apps**, which I shared in Slack, but that was done for fun and is beyond the scope of the class. In addition, I completed the solution using **classes in C++**, which was my first solution, but I'm learning C++ for myself and that is also beyond the scope of the class.

## Code

The C and C++ code is written with **JetBrains CLion**.

The C# code is written with **Visual Studio 2017**.
