# Projects

A list of personal projects to help with learning C and C++.

## Hangman

My first personal project while learning C is a [Hangman Game](https://github.com/dev-nano/c/tree/master/projects/01-hangman). At the time of its creation, I had been learning C for about 2 to 3 weeks while visiting the Salt Lake City area during the summer of 2017.

* 'a' through 'z'. You can quit at any time   *
* using the '#' symbol.                       *
*                                             *
